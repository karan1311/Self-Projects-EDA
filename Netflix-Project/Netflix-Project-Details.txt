This was my first independent project on a dataset. 
Much of the operations I perform in this are basic. Here is a list:
1. Load, explore and clean the Netflix dataset.
2. Plot basic visualizations to explore the dataset.
3. Perform statistical analysis on the dataset to find things like correlation b/w Release Year and Duration, Frequency of same-year-releases added to Netflix etc.
4. Create a basic Recommendation Engine to suggest movies/TV shows to the users based on their inputs.
